# Classify Real or Fake Job Posting

There are a lot of job advertisements on the internet, even on the reputed job advertising sites, which never seem fake. But after the selection, the so called recruiters start asking for the money and the bank details. Many of the candidates fall in their trap and loose a lot of money and the current job sometimes. So, it is better to identify whether a job advertisement posted on the site is real or fake. Identifying it manually is very difficult and almost impossible. We can apply machine learning to train a model for fake job classification. It can be trained on the previous real and fake job advertisements, and it can identify a fake job accurately.
           
 In this article, we will train the machine learning classifier on Employment Scam Aegean Dataset to identify the fake job advertisements. First, we will visualize the insights from the fake and real job advertisement and then we will use the support vector classifier in this task which will predict the real and fraudulent class labels for the job advertisements after successful training. Finally, we will evaluate the performance of our classifier using several evaluation metrics.
